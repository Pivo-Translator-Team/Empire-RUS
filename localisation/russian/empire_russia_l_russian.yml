 russia.1.b: "We shall have war!"
 russia.2.t: "Russia Demands Vassalization"
 russia.2.d: "After a long period of instability and de facto independence of our Cossack state, the Russian bear has finally turned its attention to us.

 russia.5.t: "Russia proposes a partition of Poland"
 russia.5.d: "The Russian ambassador has extended an invitation to discuss to Polish question. For many centuries the Polish-Lithuanian state has been a juggernaut of a nation, wedged between our great states. As the Commonwealth further deteriorates into instability, the Russian ambassador has argued to intervene before the situation spirals out of control. The Commonwealth is to be partitioned in three separate phases, dividing the country amongst Russia, Austria and Prussia, the so-called Three Black Eagles. The war will be swift and will face minimal resistance. How shall we respond to this intriguing proposal?"
 russia.6.t: "[From.GetName] accepts!"
 russia.6.d: "[From.GetName] has accepted our offer to intervene in the Commonwealth and partition it when deemed necessary. A great day for peace in Europe!"
 russia.7.t: "[From.GetName] refuses."
 russia.7.d: "[From.GetName] has turned down our offer to partition the Commonwealth. The work of a fool!"
 russia.8.t: "[From.GetName] occupies the Polish frontier!"
 russia.8.d: "[From.GetName] has moved in and has occupied parts of our country. As we are being threatened on all sides our military stands perplexed. How does one counter such a display of force?"
 russia.9.t: "First Partition of Poland Successful"
 russia.9.d: "The First Partition of Poland has been a great success. So far the Commonwealth has failed to respond to these territorial changes, confirming the fact it is failed state, of whom the peasants are better of in our great empire."
 mod.22.t: "First Partition of Poland"
 mod.22.d: "Following a series of agreements between Russia, Austria and Prussia, the countries have moved in and occupied parts of Poland under the justification of 'protecting the local population'. The People in the occupied areas are mostly minorities. The landgrab consist of about 30% of the Commonwealth's territory and roughly half of its population. With the seizure of north-western Poland, Prussia has also gained control over most of the Commonwealth's foreign trade. It would seem that the end of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is near, as it is now surrounded on all sides by more powerful foes and no effective way to combat them. To be continued..."
 mod.22.a: "Perhaps it was for the better."
 mod.22.b: "We did what had to be done."
 mod.22.c: "What do you mean, 'first'????."

 russia.12.t: "Exploration in Alaska"
 russia.12.d: "As our explorers ventured through Alaska, they found an unhospitable and cold wasteland, very alike the northern regions of Siberia. However, the rumour of resources like gold and iron in the region will surely attract settlers for our first overseas expansion."

 russia.13.d: "In a recent correspondence with the Russian embassy, our ambassadors have learned Russia seeks our immediate cessation of diplomatic ties with the Cossack state, also known as Zaporozhia. Zaporozhia is a rogue state, regularly plundering both our lands and our rival's. However, there has long been an agreement in place to keep the status quo to prevent the dominance of either one of the Great Powers in the Southern Ukraine. If we revoke our guarantee over the Cossack state, we have the benefit of Russia cleaning up the mess for us, it will however allow them to expand ever more closely to the borders of our empire."
 russia.14.t: "[From.GetName] agrees to revoke guarantee"
 russia.14.d: "[From.GetName] has agreed to not intervene in our future invasion plans of the Cossack state, allowing us to finally deal with this terroristic state at once. The time to restore civilization in the South has drawn near!"

The lower Dniepr area, south of the Zaporizhian Sich, and the area between Perekop and Miuskiy Gorodok are declared a demilitarized zone. The sultan has asserted that his subordinates, the Crimean Tatars, will not attack Russia; in turn, the tsar has promised that his subordinates, the Don Cossacks and Zaporozhian Cossacks, will not attack the Ottoman Empire. \n \nBoth parties have also agreed not to build any fortifications along the border.

 russia.21.d: "The Zaporozhian Host is demanding us to unify them with the Slobozhanshchynan Cossacks. Many among the nobility supports this decision, implying the importance of strenghening a buffer state to protect our southern flanks, meanwhile others are implying the Zaporozhian Host are asking too much and are still yet to be trusted."

 # Leaders: 
 PETER_I_DESC: "'By the grace of God, the most excellent and great sovereign emperor Pyotr Alekseevich the ruler of all the Russias: of Moscow, of Kiev, of Vladimir, of Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan and Tsar of Siberia, sovereign of Pskov, great prince of Smolensk, of Tver, of Yugorsk, of Perm, of Vyatka, of Bulgaria and others, sovereign and great prince of the Novgorod Lower lands, of Chernigov, of Ryazan, of Rostov, of Yaroslavl, of Belozersk, of Udora, of Kondia and the sovereign of all the northern lands, and the sovereign of the Iverian lands, of the Kartlian and Georgian Kings, of the Kabardin lands, of the Circassian and Mountain princes and many other states and lands western and eastern here and there and the successor and sovereign and ruler.'\n\nPeter I, son of tsar Alexis of house Romanov, succeeded his elder brother Feodor III alongside his brother Ivan V as co-monarch of Russia under the regency of his half-sister Sophia in 1682. By the summer of 1689, Peter, then age 17, planned to take power from his half-sister Sophia, whose position had been weakened by two unsuccessful Crimean campaigns against the Crimean Khanate in an attempt to stop devastating Crimean Tatar raids into Russia's southern lands. When she learned of his designs, Sophia conspired with some leaders of the Streltsy, who continually aroused disorder and dissent. Sophia was eventually overthrown, with Peter I and Ivan V continuing to act as co-tsars. Peter forced Sophia to enter a convent, where she gave up her name and her position as a member of the royal family.\n\nStill, Peter could not acquire actual control over Russian affairs. Power was instead exercised by his mother, Natalya Naryshkina. It was only when Natalya died in 1694 that Peter, now aged 22, became an independent sovereign. Formally, Ivan V was a co-ruler with Peter, though being ineffective. Peter became the sole ruler when Ivan died in 1696, while Peter was 24 years old.\n\nPeter has taken the first steps to implement sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing Russia. Heavily influenced by his advisors from Western Europe, Peter seeks to reorganize the Russian army among modern lines and has long dreamed of making Russia a maritime power. However, he has already faced opposition of the Streltsy, and many more groups threaten to overthrow his rule, the worst threat of them all being the Swedes in the Northwest. However, Peter has forged a plan to end the Swedish domination..."
