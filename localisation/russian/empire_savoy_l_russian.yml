 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Duchy of Savoy has long been dominated by France due to it's close proximity, and at the turn of the 18th Century this still seems to be the case. Victor Amadeus II is still very much under the influence of Louis XIV, although not exactly by choice. Victor Amadeus II has long wanted to escape the domination of Louis, and it seems that with the Spanish succession crisis looming, he might yet have his chance."

  # Events: 
 savoy.1.d: "Following our acquisition of the Southern Italian lands, the Savoyard ambassador has summoned us to the negotiating table. As it was previously established by the treaty of London, it was agreed that we should cede our newly acquired Italian lands to Savoy, in exchange for its transalpine territories Nice and Savoy. This would solve the issue of a difficult to manage overseas territory, fulfil our ambitions set by the Rhine-Alpes doctrine, and diffuse tensions in Italy."
 savoy.2.d: "France has accepted our request to faithfully execute the terms of the London agreement, in which we will give them Nice and Savoy, and we will receive Naples and Sicily from them."
 savoy.3.d: "France has refused our offer to exchange Nice and Savoy for Southern Italy. Whilst it is unfortunate that this way we have lost out on a major opportunity, it does mean that France has relinquished its claims on our transalpine territories for now."
 savoy.4.d: "[FROM.GetLeader], the duke of Savoy, has announced his claims on Milan. Being in the line of succession Carlos II, [FROM.GetLeader] believes he is entitled to part of the inheritance. Although this was stated nowhere in the will of Carlos II, [FROM.GetLeader] has announced his claims on Milan as his share of the inheritance. His claim is of course expected to be quite weak, which is why he looks towards the great powers of Europe to confirm his claims.\n\nWhile his claim is essentially unfounded, handing Milan to a smaller third party would likely calm down the tensions in Northern Italy. In any case, his claim stands or falls based on the support of a great power."
 savoy.5.d: "[FROM.GetName] has supported our claims to Milan. They will support our claims in the case of a treaty in which the territory is exchanged and should they themselves come in the possession of the territory; they will hand it over to us."
 savoy.6.d: "For the betterment of the war effort, Savoy has offered to take control over Southern Italy to ensure an optimal defence of those territories. "
 savoy.7.d: "[FROM.GetName] has agreed to a temporary transfer of the administration of Southern Italy, allowing us to reign over the lands until the war is over."
 savoy.8.d: "[FROM.GetName] has decided to instantiate themselves from Southern Italy and have transferred the lands to us in a permanent arrangement."
 savoy.9.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refuses our offer. We will have to acquire Southern Italy through alternative means."
 savoy.10.d: "Since we have internationally announced our support to the Savoyard claims on Milan, but have since come in control of the region, we are now bound to transfer the state to Savoy. After all, we promised to support their claim whatever happens."
 savoy.11.d: "Savoy, officially still holding lands of the Holy Roman Empire (Savoy region), has now officially asked for the protection of the emperor. They fear that France is increasingly forcing its influence on Savoy, and now they want a guarantee to protect them from French agression."
 savoy.12.d: "The emperor has agreed to our calling and has now promised to protect us at any cost."
 savoy.13.d: "The emperor has ignored our call for protection. Clearly, they have not forgotten about our political manoeuvres in the war of the league of Augsburg. Anyways, the cowardly emperor's signal is clear: we stand alone."
 savoy.14.d: "[FROM.GetName] has not broken their word. They previously were among the few to recognize our claims on Milan, and now since they have gained the region for themselves, they have decided to transfer the territory to its rightful owner, namely us."
 savoy.15.d: "Although Savoy is currently aligned with France, we have received secret correspondence they seek to change sides and join the Grand Alliance against France. It is long known that Savoy has lived in the shadow of France and was long bullied into a toxic relation with them. Now they seek to finally break free from the pressure of France and join the Grand Alliance to bring down the hegemon for once and for all."
 savoy.16.d: "We have been welcomed into the Grand Alliance. The time of being France's lapdog is over! Now we will teach the French a lesson and go conquer our rightful claims."
 savoy.17.d: "Our reputation as a backstabbing nation has come to haunt us. As we have been known to be an unreliable ally, often switching sides in the middle of the conflict (allegedly), we have been barred from entry into Grand Alliance. It seems like we are stuck on the losing side again."
 savoy.18.d: "Savoy has requested they be given Milan as compensation for entry into our faction and contribution to the war effort. Although stated nowhere in his will, Vittorio Amadeo is a relative of Carlos II, and thinks he is therefore entitled to a part of this inheritance. He has now requested Milan as his 'fair share' of the inheritance for his contributions on the side of the Bourbon Alliance."
 savoy.19.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted and has vacated Milan immediately. We are now officially the owner of the Duchy."
 savoy.20.d: "[FROM.GetName] has refused to transfer Milan to us, proving once again that we are nothing more but a tool to them to help win their wars. We will not take kindly to this development."
 savoy.21.d: "[FROM.GetName] seeks to abandon its Habsburg overlords and seeks to join the war on the side of house Bourbon."
 savoy.22.d: "France has accepted our entry in their faction, meaning we will now fight for the side of Philip V of Spain."
 savoy.23.d: "France has refused to grant us a truce. Our final hopes of getting out of this mess have been crushed."
 savoy.24.d: "We have long sought to gain the region of Milan. Milan is increasingly a source of international tensions, so any great power would be wise to hand it over to a minor power. Of course they won't simply throw it away, but a pretty price will convince them otherwise."
 savoy.25.d: "We have received a modest offer from Savoy, where they offer a price for Milan. If we accept, they will pay us handsomely, and we will lose control over a territory which was honestly not very productive for our empire anyways."
 savoy.26.d: "We have received a generous offer from Savoy, where they offer a price for Milan. If we accept, they will pay us handsomely, and we will lose control over a territory which was honestly not very productive for our empire anyways."
 savoy.27.d: "We have received a very generous offer from Savoy, where they offer a price for Milan. If we accept, they will pay us handsomely, and we will lose control over a territory which was honestly not very productive for our empire anyways."
 savoy.28.d: "Our offer was accepted! The Savoyard economy is expected to temporarily suffer from this massive expenditure, but at least we now finally have Milan."
 savoy.29.d: "Despite it being so generous, our offer was turned down in the end. [FROM.GetName] seems to be wanting to cling on to Milan indefinitely, making war the only possible option to acquire the territory in the foreseeable future."
 savoy.30.d: "Rebels are running amok in our country, protesting so called occupation by a foreign power and wanting a return of an Italian monarch. Of course everyone knows the king knows what’s best for our country, but these rebels cannot be reasoned with. The damage is large, but we will survive this ordeal."
 savoy.31.d: "A Savoyard coup has successfully managed to bring Naples under Savoyard control, introducing a policy of 'Italy for the Italians'. It remains to be seen how the rest of Europe will react to this sudden and illegal move."
 savoy.32.d: "An attempted Savoyard coup in Naples has caused major international outrage. War is expected to break out in the Italian peninsula momentarily."
 savoy.33.d: "In the 17th century Savoy and Portugal were close to unifying their thrones were it not for an intervention of the scheming Louis XIV. Now that he is preoccupied, Savoy seems to be coming back to this deal, seeking to reignite the old ties between our nations."
 savoy.34.d: "Portugal has accepted the arrangement of a royal marriage, uniting our houses in holy matrimony!"

This is a glorious day in the history of Savoy, which will soon be able to call itself a kingdom and formally take its place among the leading secondary powers of Europe."
