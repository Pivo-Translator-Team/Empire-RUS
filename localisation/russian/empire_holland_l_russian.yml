 holland.1.t: "Death of William III"
 holland.1.d: "Dark days have befallen us. William III, our glorious Stadholder, has passed away. We mourn his loss, but for now we have no Stadholder and Anthonie Heinsius must take the reigns of the kingdom."
 holland.2.t: "Holland requests William to return to the Netherlands."
 holland.2.d: "Herald from the Netherlands! The States-General of the Netherlands have requested the immediate return of William to the Netherlands, so he might strengthen the position of the Orangists in the Netherlands. Whilst this will significantly strengthen our ally in the Netherlands, it will most definitely undermine his authority in England."
 holland.3.t: "The Prince of Orange returns!"
 holland.3.d: "Great news! William of Orange has heeded the call of his people and has departed London to return at his home in Den Haag at once! The people rejoice, for their liege is coming home. How he will manage England and Scotland in the meantime is not known."
 holland.4.t: "William remains in England..."
 holland.4.d: "William III has communicated that even though it pains his heart, he has too many pressing matters in England and is not in a position to return home to his subjects in the Netherlands."
 holland.5.t: "Netherlands seek a truce"
 holland.5.d: "Following a change in the government in the Netherlands, a new faction has taken control over the nation, vastly opposed to the war against France. They seek to leave the Grand Alliance immediately and enter into a truce with our nation. How shall we respond to this rapprochement of the Dutch government?"
 holland.6.t: "France accepts truce!"
 holland.6.d: "For the good of all the nation and the Dutch trade interests around the globe, France has accepted our truce!"
 holland.7.t: "France refuses Truce!"
 holland.7.d: "France has denied us the opportunity of a truce, giving us no choice but to keep up the war effort against them."
 holland.8.t: "[FROM.GetName] proposes partition of Southern Netherlands"
 holland.8.d: "The Dutch have approached us with the intriguing proposal to enact an old proposal, that once existed between France and the United Provinces during the Devolution War. The plan involved a partition of the Netherlands, in which the Netherlands would receive the northern Dutch speaking regions, and we the French speaking south. The plan was eventually scrapped because of the 'Galica Amica Sed Non Vicina'-doctrine, meaning as much that the Netherlands would like to keep us as a friend, but not a neighbour. Now that there is a more reasonable Dutch government, they have come to revise this doctrine, leaving us with this interesting proposal."
 holland.9.t: "France Refuses"
 holland.9.d: "Our ambassadors report unfortunate news from Paris. Even though Louis XIV had originally proposed partition plan De Witt himself in 1663, he has now decided to waive the idea. Our hopes to reclaim Flanders and Brabant seem far off dreams now."
 holland.10.t: "France Accepts"
 holland.10.d: "France has accepted the plan to partition the Netherlands. As soon as either of us controls the Southern Netherlands, the lands will be immediately partitioned as agreed."
 holland.11.t: "Honouring the partition plan?"
 holland.11.d: "Now that we have control over the Southern Netherlands, the question of the partition plan de Witt comes to mind. As we control a larger section of the land than was originally owed, we could return the land to our partner. Or we could just keep it for ourselves..."
 holland.12.t: "Honouring the partition plan?"
 holland.12.d: "Now that we have control over the Southern Netherlands, the question of the partition plan de Witt comes to mind. As we control a larger section of the land than was originally owed, we could return the land to our partner. Or we could just keep it for ourselves..."
 holland.13.t: "[FROM.GetName] honours partition!"
 holland.13.d: "[FROM.GetName] has honoured the agreement to partition the Southern Netherlands. Glory to them, and glory to us!"
 holland.14.t: "[FROM.GetName] dishonours partition!"
 holland.14.d: "The vile traitors of [FROM.GetName] have dishonoured the agreed partition of the Southern Netherlands, greedily clinging to land that was promised to us. This terrible treason can only be answered in one way."
 holland.15.t: "Personal Union Over The Netherlands"
 holland.15.d: "After the passing of the late king his majesty William III, the Netherlands found themselves in a difficult situation as the stadtholder had not fathered any offspring. Whilst for a moment it looked like the Netherlands were simply going to abandon the idea of a hereditary stadtholder altogether, they have eventually decided it is best for the status of the Netherlands in Europe to keep a monarch. Surprisingly, they have altered their rules of succession, and have invited our beloved queen Anne as ruler to govern their nation. This effectively continues the situation that has existed between the Netherlands and [ENG.GetName] since the Glorious Revolution in 1688. The recent turn of events, however, leads us to believe that the Netherlands now seek closer ties to our country than ever before."
 holland.16.d: "With the passing of the childless William III of Orange, a nephew of Frederick I, a clear succession dispute has come into existence. Officially, the title is supposed to pass to either Frederick, or John William Friso. The latter, however, is seen to have slightly more legitimacy as he already holds the stadholdership of Friesland. However, no official successor has been designated, making it possible for Prussia to make a move on the Netherlands."
 holland.17.d: "In an unexpected political manoeuvre, [PRS.GetLeader] has declared himself as the rightful successor to the title ‘Prince of Orange’. [PRS.GetLeader] is the nephew of the late William III of Orange, who had a childless marriage with Mary Stuart of England. Although his claim can be seen as legitimate, the claim by John William Friso of Naussau-Dietz is seen as superior to the claim of the Prussian prince-elector. Whilst the majors of Amsterdam have already invited him to a meeting in the Amsterdamer theatre, the claim by [PRS.GetLeader] has been received poorly by most officials in Holland. \n \nThe biggest losers of this whole episode are the Orangists, the faction in support of the prince of Orange. The situation has proven that the dynastic questions are a threat to the stability of the Netherlands. The statists have once again urged for the abolishment of the title in Dutch politics and have aimed to reform the Netherlands into a proper republic."
  
 holland.20.d: "Following Their Reconquest of the Low Countries after more than 100 years, the [FROM.GetName] have requested the transfer of Artois as rightful territorial claim of the Burgundian Imperial Circle."
 holland.21.d: "Even though we did not really expect it, our hopes have come true. [FROM.GetName] has agreed to hand over Artois without struggle, as part of a wider understanding in the European community to maintain stability and peace."
 holland.22.d: "As we might have expected, [FROM.GetName] will not simply hand over Artois without struggle. Our disappointment is immeasurable, and our day is ruined, but it seems like it is a reality we will have to live with."
 holland.23.d: "Following Their Reconquest of the Low Countries after more than 100 years, the [FROM.GetName] have requested the transfer of Cleves as rightful territorial claim of the Burgundian Imperial Circle."
 holland.24.d: "Even though we did not really expect it, our hopes have come true. [FROM.GetName] has agreed to hand over Cleves without struggle, as part of a wider understanding in the European community to maintain stability and peace."
 holland.25.d: "As we might have expected, [FROM.GetName] will not simply hand over Cleves without struggle. Our disappointment is immeasurable, and our day is ruined, but it seems like it is a reality we will have to live with."
