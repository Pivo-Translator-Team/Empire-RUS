 ottomans.1.d: "On 26 January 1699, the treaty of Karlowitz was signed after two months of negotiations between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, thus concluding the Great Turkish war of 1683-1697. The Ottomans had been defeated at Vienna in 1683 and the following years were disastrous for the Turks. The war has been devastating, the losses have been great. It must be agreed upon that the terms proposed by the Holy League were reasonable. Will peace finally return to the Europe?"
 ottomans.1.a: "We can only accept these terms..."
 ottomans.1.b: "No! These demands are unacceptable! We would rather die fighting!"
 ottomans.2.t: "Sweden Requests Intervention against Russia"
 ottomans.2.d: "Seeing the tide of war turn against them, the Swedes have approached us with the urgent request to stage an intervention against Russia, preventing them from destroying Sweden. While we are definitely no friends of the Russians, it is without a doubt that breaking the established truce between ourselves and the Russians may have severe repercussions, not to mention the potential loss of life. On the other hand, if Russia would defeat its northern rival, they will be able to divert all their power to the southern front, threatening our highly disputed possessions in the Crimea. Nothing is without risk, and it is up to the Sultan to decide the course of action."
 ottomans.3.t: "Ottomans pledge their support"
 ottomans.3.d: "The Ottomans have pledged their support to our cause against the Russians and have promised to intervene against them as soon as all armies are in place. Those Russians won't know what hit ‘em!"

 ottomans.5.d: "Disappointingly, we have received the news that the Ottomans will not be engaging in a war with Russia any time soon. Sad news indeed. However, we should not despair, as peace between the Ottomans and Russia seldom lasts."

The Sultan is now faced with a decision, give the soldiers a temporary pay raise, or face the possibility of a mutiny."
 ottomans.15.a: "Fine, pay them extra."
 ottomans.15.b: "They fight for the Sultan, not for money!"
 ottomans.16.t: "Janissaries Left Behind"
 ottomans.16.d: "Following the vast land reform, the Janissaries in particular feel left behind. Not compensating them might have dire results. How shall we deal with the situation?"
 ottomans.16.a: "Compensate them with cash."
 ottomans.16.b: "Nothing, they had too much influence anyways."
