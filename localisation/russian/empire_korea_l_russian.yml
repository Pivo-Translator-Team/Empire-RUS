 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Kingdom of Great Joseon, or the Hermit Kingdom, has a rich cultural history and a long history of struggling against foreign occupation. First by the Mongols, and then by the Manchus. However, it seems that Korean independence is secure for now, although danger always lurks around the corner. The kingdom is a vassal state of the Qing, and the Manchus might wish to reconsider their current stance on Korea. Furthermore, to the South lies Japan, and many Japanese still hold dreams of Korean conquest and remember the Imjin war, where Korea was almost conquered by Japan..."
