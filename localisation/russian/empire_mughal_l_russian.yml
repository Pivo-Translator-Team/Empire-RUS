 MUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Mughals have almost achieved complete domination of India, the land of riches and spices. However, one obstacle remains in their way. The Marathas, who have been resisting them for almost two decades now. The situation does not look good for the Mughals, their army is depleted, the generals are adivising retreat, and even though territorial gains have been made, it looks like the tide is turning in the favour of the Marathas. What will become of this titanic battle? For whoever wins it is almost guaranteed to have total domination over all of India."

  # Events:

 mughal.1.a: "Pull out of the Deccan"
 mughal.1.b: "Fight the Maratha Rats"
 mughal.2.t: "Our Options"
 mughal.2.d: "Now that we have chosen to continue fighting the Marathas, we have a number of options available to us on how to tackle them. We can do these three things:"
 mughal.2.a: "Purchase weapons"
 mughal.2.b: "Cut Court Spending"
 mughal.2.c: "Infiltrate Maratha Territory"
 mughal.3.t: "Mughals Sue for Peace"
 mughal.3.d: "The Mughals have begun pulling out of the Deccan, and as such have contacted us with surrender terms. No doubt they will build up their strength and attack us again, so we must make sure that we are prepared once they do."
 mughal.3.a: "Excellent. Let us begin preparations."
 mughal.4.t: "Religious Reform"
 mughal.4.d: "Religion has always been a key factor to ruling India, ever since the Mughal Empire was formed. While the Emperor has traditionally followed an orthodox and intolerant approach, maybe the time has come to discuss options and avenues for our future religious policies. What we decide here will have a large impact on the nation, and both options come with pros and cons. Choose wisely."
 mughal.4.a: "Oppression"
 mughal.4.b: "Liberalization"
 mughal.5.t: "Infighting in the Mughal Court"
 mughal.5.d: "Ever since the humiliation of our loss the Mughal court has been fighting among itself, and factionalism and political chaos are running rampant. Much work must be done in order for us to cleanse the court of instigators and pretenders to the throne."

 mughal.10.t: "The Problems we Face"
 mughal.10.d: "Now that the war is over, numerous problems plaguing the Empire have come to our notice. First and foremost is the decentralized nature of administration, which is growing more and more day by day. Whilst we were busy in the Deccan, many states and territories have become nominally independent with us having little to no control over them. The most pressing of these states is Bengal, which can declare independence anytime it wishes. We must solve this issue, and fast."
 mughal.10.a: "What am I supposed to do?"
 mughal.11.t: "The Mughals Propose an Alliance against the Safavids"
 mughal.11.d: "The Mughals have come to us with an alliance offer against the Safavids.

They are likely to take any option we present to them, as long as they are allowed to keep their core lands. With both sides wishing for an end to the war, there are many options that the Shahenshah can take to finally end this conflict."
 mughal.13.a: "Give the Ottomans their promised lands and take Qandahar, Herat, and Baluchistan."
 mughal.13.b: "Puppet the Persians and give the Ottomans the promised lands."
 mughal.13.c: "All of Persia goes to us. The Ottomans can cry all they want."

 mughal.16.t: "The English wish to negiotiate"
 mughal.16.d: "The English are willing to sell the territories we have demanded at a fair price, this is quite an easy way to avoid an unnecessary war and gain some territory. We will be able to pay the price, however it will place a strain on our treasury for some time. What do we do?"
 mughal.16.a: "A good offer. Pay the stipulated amount."
 mughal.16.b: "No. We will only accept these territories free of charge."
 mughal.17.t: "The Mughals agree to negiotiate"
 mughal.17.d: "The Mughals have seen sense and have agreed to pay the amount we stipulated. Bloodshed has been avoided, and we can always return to India later."
 mughal.17.a: "Easy money."
 mughal.18.t: "The Mughals refuse to negiotiate"
 mughal.18.d: "The Mughals have lost hold of their senses. They do not wish to negiotiate anymore, and have demanded the territories for the last time. If we do not agree to these demands war is inevietable. What do we do?"
 mughal.18.a: "Brutes. Agree to their ultimatum, there is nothing we can do."

 mughal.19.t: "The English Refuse to give in"

 mughal.20.t: "The Mughals De-escalate"
 mughal.20.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the Mughals have given up on their ultimatum and it seems that the situation has returned to normal. A diplomatic victory for us. We should probably shore up defences in our overseas colonies however."
 mughal.20.a: "Excellent news."
 mughal.21.t: "Mughals Declare War"
 mughal.21.d: "The Mughals have decided to declare war after all. Our position is hard to defend, but we can do it. Death or Glory!"

 mughal.22.d: "The English have caved to our demands, this is a glorious victory for the Mughal Empire. Now we can continue on to the rest of the foreign invaders."
 mughal.22.a: "Excellent."
 mughal.23.t: "The Mughals Capture our last stronghold"
 mughal.23.d: "With the swift loss of our territories within India, we have no choice but to sue for peace. We will have to pay reparations and formally recognize Mughal suzerainty over the territories. A great loss for the English Empire today."
 mughal.23.a: "This is terrible..."
 mughal.24.t: "Mughals Demand Dutch India"

 mughal.27.d: "For quite some time now the nomads and tribal peoples of Afghanistan have posed a problem to anyone who rules over them. Now that we have taken these territories from the Persians, it is our job to quell their rebelliousness. We must crush these tribes before we can continue our advance into Asia."
 mughal.27.a: "They will not last long..."
 mughal.28.t: "Tribals damage infrastructure in Balochistan"
 mughal.28.d: "The tribal people have damaged infrastructure across the state of Balochistan, and it will take quite a while to repair it."
 mughal.28.a: "They must be crushed."
 mughal.29.t: "Tribals damage infrastructure in Herat"
 mughal.29.d: "The tribal people have damaged infrastructure across the state of Herat, and it will take quite a while to repair it."
 mughal.29.a: "They must be crushed."
 mughal.30.t: "Tribals damage infrastructure in Qandahar"
 mughal.30.d: "The tribal people have damaged infrastructure across the state of Qandahar, and it will take quite a while to repair it."
 mughal.30.a: "They must be crushed."
 mughal.31.t: "Tribals ambush our troops"
 mughal.31.d: "The tribal people have ambushed our patrolling troops in the mountains, and have killed many. They have also proceeded to steal the patrols weapons. This cannot go on."
 mughal.31.a: "They must be crushed."
 mughal.32.t: "Mughals propose economic cooperation"
 mughal.32.d: "The Mughal Empire has proposed a series of treaties and agreements in the name of economic cooperation between our two empires. While these foreign barbarians are no match for us terms of overall production, they are quite formidable in the textile industry. Accepting these dealings will no doubt be beneficial for both of our nations, however do we really want to help an strange country who might have ulterior motives in mind?"
 mughal.32.a: "Why not? We accept."
 mughal.32.b: "No. We will not accept this offer."
 mughal.33.t: "The Qing accepts our offer"
 mughal.33.d: "The Chinese have wisely accepted our offer of economic cooperation, and as a result both of our nations are reaping the benefits of closer cooperation."
 mughal.33.a: "Excellent."
 mughal.34.t: "The Qing rejects our offer"
 mughal.34.d: "The Chinese has rejected our offer of economic cooperation, setting back relations between our two countries. This is quite a blow to our future efforts to bring together our Empires."
 mughal.34.a: "That's quite annoying..."
 mughal.35.t: "Fall of Peking"
 mughal.35.d: "The Chinese capital of Peking has fallen, and the Qing have surrendered unconditionally. Taking land from them is not very wise as we cannot adequately support and supply our troops in the region, we can make them pay war reparations and gain some other benefits. What do we do?"
 mughal.35.a: "Demand reparations and overlordship of Tibet."
 mughal.35.b: "Dismantle the Tributary System and claim overlordship over all Chinese tributary states."
 mughal.35.c: "Claim the Mandate of Heaven for ourselves!"
 mughal.36.t: "Mughals propose military cooperation"
 mughal.36.d: "The Mughals have contacted us once again, and has proposed military cooperation between our Empires. The Mughal style of warfare is quite different from ours, and no doubt both of our countries can benefit from this proposition. What do we do?"
 mughal.36.a: "An excellent offer. We accept."
 mughal.37.t: "China accepts military cooperation"
 mughal.37.d: "The Chinese have accepted our proposal of military cooperation, and will send a detachment of men annually to India to learn from us and teach us their tactics. We shall of course, do the same."
 mughal.37.a: "Excellent."
 mughal.38.t: "The Mughals propose further cooperation"
 mughal.38.d: "The Mughals have now proposed further cooperation between our two Empires, in the form of a formal military alliance. With this alliance we would be obligated to help the Mughals in their military conflicts, and they in ours. It is an interesting offer, but in the end the choice is with us. What do we do?"
 mughal.38.a: "We accept. We will dominate Asia together."
 mughal.38.b: "No, we would prefer to go it alone."
 mughal.39.t: "Dealing with the Qing"
 mughal.39.d: "The Qing Empire is massive and dominates most of Asia. It's military might is renowned, and it's use of gunpowdwer is feared by many. We can either choose to continue a peace with the Qing, and maybe even cooperate and form an alliance, or we can decide to fight them and become the undisputed hegemons of Asia."
 mughal.39.a: "We will fight the Qing."
 mughal.39.b: "We will cooperate with the Qing."
 mughal.40.t: "The Mughals demand our Submission"
 mughal.40.d: "The Mughals have demanded that we submit to them and allow them to occupy our country. We have almost no chance of resisting this new foe, what do we do?"
 mughal.40.a: "We have no choice. We accept."
 mughal.40.b: "No, our country is our own. We will fight!"
 mughal.41.t: "Lan Na Accepts"
 mughal.41.d: "Lan Na has accepted our ultimatum, and we have won land without shedding any blood. An easy victory for the Mughal Empire."
 mughal.41.a: "Excellent."
 mughal.42.t: "Lan Na Rejects the Ultimatum"
 mughal.42.d: "Surprisingly, Lan Na has rejected our ultimatum. This is preposterous, and we must declare war immediately."
 mughal.42.a: "War it is then..."
 mughal.43.t: "The Mughals expand into our sphere of influence"
 mughal.43.d: "The Mughals have declared war on Burma, and this is quite a troubling turn of events. No doubt they aim to conquer all of Asia, and will be coming for us next. Before matters get out of hand, we should stop them now. Alternatively, they could simply be conquering another petty kingdom. What do we do?"
 mughal.43.a: "Tell the Mughals to stop invading Burma at once."
 mughal.43.b: "We have no desire to intervene in conflicts outside our borders."
 mughal.44.t: "The Qing ask us to halt our invasion"
 mughal.44.d: "The Qing Empire has asked us to stop our invasion of Burma immediately and return back to India. No doubt they are afraid that they will be next once Burma falls. What do we do?"
 mughal.44.a: "Fine... We'll call back our troops."
 mughal.44.b: "Burma is ours. Nothing can stop us now."
 mughal.45.t: "The Mughals back down"
 mughal.45.d: "The Mughals have acquiesced and have pulled out of Burma. We have successfully shown our strength and the Mughals will not try to invade our sphere anytime soon. Hurrah for the Qing!"
 mughal.45.a: "Excellent news."
 mughal.46.t: "The Mughals continue"
 mughal.46.d: "The Mughals have ignored our request and have continued advancing into Burma. It is very unlikely that the Burmese can hold out without our help much longer. What do we do?"
 mughal.46.a: "Let us help the Burmese!"
 mughal.46.b: "This is not worth it..."
 mughal.47.t: "China declares War"
 mughal.47.d: "The Qing have declared war in support of the Burmese, and we will have to contend with them now as well. May god help us in this collasal battle..."
 mughal.47.a: "..."
 mughal.48.t: "The Qing back down"
 mughal.48.d: "The Qing have backed down, no doubt afraid of our military might. This is a great victory for our Empire, and now the road to all of South East Asia lays open!"
 mughal.48.a: "Ha!"
 mughal.49.t: "The Mughals Demand Tribute"
 mughal.49.d: "After the fall of our overlord, China, the Mughals have demanded we pay tribute to them. How do we respond to these outrageous demands?"
 mughal.49.a: "Alright."
 mughal.49.b: "No, we will not be paying any tribute."
 mughal.50.t: "Maratha Resistance"
 mughal.50.d: "The Marathas have proven that they will not go down quietly, as even after we crushed their forces on the battlefield they have taken to underground resistance and guerilla warfare. Quite adept at this art, we will have to focus considerable resources in order to defeat the Maratha remnants."
 mughal.50.a: "We will stomp these rats out once and for all!"
 mughal.51.t: "Marathas damage infrastructure"
 mughal.51.d: "Maratha rebels recently sallied forth from their bases and destroyed valuable military infrastructure across the region, which has already begun to slow down trade and cause chaos among our troops in the area. Something must be done!"
 mughal.51.a: "We are working on it."
 mughal.52.t: "Marathas damage civilian manufactory"
 mughal.52.d: "The Marathas have taken it upon themselves to damage our industry in the South, to hinder our attempts to turn it into a productive area. A few civilian manufactories were damaged, and it will take a lot of money to repair them."
 mughal.52.a: "They will stop at nothing!"
 mughal.53.t: "Marathas damage military manufactory"
 mughal.53.d: "Maratha rebels attacked our military manufactories and blacksmiths early this morning, stealing weapons and killing the guards at the premises. The manufactory they attacked will be out of comission for some time."
 mughal.53.a: "Preposterous!"
 mughal.54.t: "Marathas kill fort keeper"
 mughal.54.d: "Maratha agents infiltrated some of our forts and killed their fort keepers, the troops stationed there were not able to stop them from doing so however they did manage to kill these spies. It will take some time and resources to replace these fort keepers, especially with no one able or no one willing to take the job due to the fear of being assassinated by the Marathas..."
 mughal.54.a: "Damn them!"
 mughal.55.t: "Marathas instigate local populace"
 mughal.55.d: "The Marathas have managed to turn some of the local populace against us and have increased resistance in the region. This is a very grave situation indeed..."
 mughal.55.a: "We must crush them immediately!"
 mughal.56.t: "A Rebellious Populace"
 mughal.56.d: "Evidently, the Marathas are not the only ones unhappy about our occupation of their territory. No doubt instigated by Maratha agents, the local populace is quite feisty and rebellious, and has already made it's displeasure known by killing our patrols and hindering our efforts to stabilize the region. They will somewhat disperse once the Maratha remnants are crushed, however we must focus on gaining supporters within the populace and stabilizing the region to eliminate any dissent."
 mughal.56.a: "We must alleviate their troubles."
 mughal.57.t: "The Mughals Propose a permanent Alliance"
 mughal.57.d: "The Mughals have approached us with the offer of a permanent military alliance, how do we respond?"
 mughal.57.a: "Yes, we accept."
 mughal.57.b: "No, we would prefer not to."
 mughal.58.t: "The Ottomans Refuse"
 mughal.58.d: "The Ottomans have refused our alliance offer. Any further cooperation is rather unlikely."
 mughal.58.a: "Unfortunate indeed."
 mughal.59.t: "The Zamindari System"
 mughal.59.d: "There are two types of 'Zamindars', one is essentially a vassal or a chief who controls a province and has agreed to submit to us while supporting us militarily and economically. This rank is typically heriditary. The other is typically a landowning person who collects revenue, exercises power over peasants who work on his land, and is appointed by us. It has become apparent that this system has become quite inefficient, the ryots (peasants) are overtaxed and overworked, and are treated cruelly by our zamindors. Something must be done and it must be supplanted with a new system and more efficient system. Furthermore it might also be wise to fully subjugate the semi-autonomous rajas of the land, as their loyalties can shift and change like the tides."
 mughal.59.a: "Dismantle the system at once."
 mughal.59.b: "Deal with it slowly."
 mughal.59.c: "Why don't we support this system?"
 mughal.60.t: "Opposition to foreign cooperation"
 mughal.60.d: "There is a growing opposition to fraternizing with the foreigners on our shores within the court. Many claim that trading with the foreigners even more than we already are will allow them to infiltrate the country and take advantage of us when the oppurtunity is presented, along with monopolizing our markets and destroying local businesses in the process. These are all valid points, but there is not much we can do to respond. We should try and prove that the foreigners do not mean any harm to our nation, but it is unlikely this is possible."
 mughal.60.a: "Damn these nobles and their wiliness..."
 mughal.61.t: "The English expand their influence in Surat"
 mughal.61.d: "The English have set out from their factory in Surat and have taken it upon themselves to take over some of the local businesses which were not doing so well. Although this is quite a normal move in the finiancial world, it has only served to increase the opposition to the English and foreign influence in general within the court. Maybe it would be prudent to take some measures?..."
 mughal.61.a: "No, this is not something that should be punished."
 mughal.61.b: "How dare they abuse our generosity? We must do something!"
 mughal.62.t: "The Dutch expand their influence in Chinsura"
 mughal.62.d: "The Dutch have set out from their factory in Chinsura and have decided to take over some of the ailing local businesses near them. Although a fairly normal move in the finiancial world, it has only served to increase the opposition to the Dutch and foreign influence in general within the court. Maybe it would be prudent to take some measures?..."
 mughal.63.t: "The Portuguese expand their influence in Hooghly"
 mughal.63.d: "The Portuguese have set out from their factory in Hooghly and have decided to take over some of the ailing local businesses near them. Although a fairly normal move in the finiancial world, it has only served to increase the opposition to the Portuguese and foreign influence in general within the court. Maybe it would be prudent to take some measures?..."
 mughal.64.t: "The French expand their influence in Chandernagore"
 mughal.64.d: "The French have set out from their factory in Chandernagore and have decided to take over some of the ailing local businesses near them. Although a fairly normal move in the finiancial world, it has only served to increase the opposition to the French and foreign influence in general within the court. Maybe it would be prudent to take some measures?..."
 mughal.65.t: "Marathas Surrender"
 mughal.65.d: "After decades of grueling fighting, the end of the war is near. The Marathas have sent a message to us, agreeing to an unconditional surrender. The country can finally heal, and we can finally move on to our other projects."
 mughal.65.a: "Finally."
 mughal.66.t: "The Mughal Empire Demands our Submission"
 mughal.66.d: "The Mughal Empire has demanded our submission, they will declare war on us if we do not accept. What do we do?"
 mughal.66.a: "We must accept."
 mughal.66.b: "No! Never!"
 mughal.67.t: "Venad Yields"
 mughal.67.d: "Venad has yielded to our supreme might, our soldiers are moving into their territories as we speak. They are now nothing more than another addition to our glorious Empire."
 mughal.67.a: "Excellent."
 mughal.69.t: "Keladi Yields"
 mughal.69.d: "The Keladi Nayak Kingdom has yielded to our supreme might, our soldiers are moving into their territories as we speak. They are now nothing more than another addition to our glorious Empire."
 mughal.69.a: "Excellent."

 AURANGZEB_DESC: "Aurangzeb, also known as Muhi al-Din Muhammad, was born in 1618 to Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. He rose to power as the ruler of the vast Mughal Empire after defeating his brother, Dara Shikoh, in a brutal civil war and imprisoning his own father in the Agra Fort. Following the execution of his two brothers and the alleged poisoning of his nephew, a coronation ceremony was held in Delhi in 1658, where he was crowned as "Alamgir" or "Conqueror of the World."\n\nDespite his employment of many Hindus in the Mughal Administration, Aurangzeb is an orthodox Muslim who has taken controversial measures to enforce Islamic law. He has destroyed several significant Hindu temples and imposed the Jizya tax on all non-Muslims, which has fueled widespread resentment and opposition among non-Muslims.\n\nThe Mughals and the Marathas have been at odds since the Maratha State's inception. After a series of wars, peace was eventually achieved. However, after the founder of the Maratha State, Shivaji, passed away, Aurangzeb launched a massive campaign to subdue the Deccan plateau, a region that has long resisted Mughal rule. The two sides have been at war since 1681, with Aurangzeb gaining some land but failing to crush the Maratha kingdom entirely. Despite this, he was successful in annexing the states of Golconda and Bijapur.\n\nThis ongoing conflict between the Mughals and the Marathas is extremely important, whoever emerges victorious will undoubtedly rule over all of India, and perhaps even beyond the entire world."
